--Maharashtra's House Price Prediction
I'd like to share my end-to-end Machine Learning project on predicting house prices in Maharashtra, India. This project was created as part of my learning journey, and I'm excited to share it with you!


--Project Goal
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict the price of a house in Maharashtra based on various factors such as location, size, amenities, and more. This model can be used by potential home buyers, sellers, and investors to make more informed decisions.
